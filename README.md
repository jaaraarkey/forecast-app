# My First API Experiments

This project showcases my initial experiments with APIs by building a weather web app.

## Overview

This web app fetches and displays weather data using the `weather.com API` and `unsplice API`. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data
- Displays weather information in a user-friendly interface
- Utilizes `weather.com API` for weather data
- Utilizes `unsplice API` for additional functionality

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web app
- **CSS**: For styling the web app
- **JavaScript**: For the functionality and API integration

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-web-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd weather-web-app
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the app

## API Integration

- **weather.com API**: Used to fetch the latest weather data.
- **unsplice API**: Used for additional data processing.
